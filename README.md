## How it works

We use [Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) to get a virtual machine designed to run Visual Studio Code.
Then we use [webtop](https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-webtop/) to start a docker container including a desktop environment and tools to make is accessible in the browser.

Take a look at the .devcontainer folder for details and feel free to modify it to your needs.

## Tailscale

You can you Tailscale to connect to other devices and networks.

``` shell
tailscale up --accept-routes
```

You'll only need to run `tailscale up` once per Codespace.
The Tailscale state will be saved between rebuilds.
